### **Rules**
Each player starts the game with ten *white cards*.  
The fastest to answer the *toss* question begins as the *Czar*.

A *black card* is played and each player picks a *white card* to fill-in-the-blank or answer the *black card*'s question. The chosen *white cards* are displayed to all and the *Czar* player then proceeds to choose the funniest.  

The winner of the current round wins 100 *KickA$$ points* and becomes the new *Czar*. A new round begins, everyone draws back up to ten *white cards* and a new *black card* is played.

### **End of the game**
The game stops after twenty rounds. The player who has the most KickA$$ points wins the game.
